## Airport Challenge

Airport Challenge (see the Makers Github repo [here](https://github.com/makersacademy/airport_challenge "Makers Airport Challenge Github") for more info) responds to the following:

*We have a request from a client to write the software to control the flow of planes at an airport. The planes can land and take off provided that the weather is sunny. Occasionally it may be stormy, in which case no planes can land or take off.*
